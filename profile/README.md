## Current Work in Progress
We currently work on FIDO2.

As soon as we have setup a milestone for the FIDO2 release we will it publish so progress can be followed. 
In mean while, check out the [fido2-demo repository](https://github.com/tillitis/fido2-demo), which contains the demo we showed at SecurityFest 2025. 

**NB:** It's only a demo. Try it for fun, do not use in production.

**NB2:** FIDO2 runs only on Castor platform, currently in [alpha release](https://github.com/tillitis/tillitis-key1/releases/tag/TK1-Castor-alpha-1).

### About repositories, branches and releases

Main branches in all repositories are in development. We _aim_ to keep main branches buildable and workning at all times, 
but it's not guaranteed and there are some things to keep in mind:

- Main branches can be incompatible between repositories. 
- To ensure compatibility between repositories use tagged releases, where compatibility is noted.
- Main branch can be used for e.g. early testing of new features.
