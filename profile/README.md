## About repositories, branches and releases

Main branches in all repositories are in development. We aim to keep them buildable at all times, but there are some things to keep in mind.

- Main branches can be incompatible between repositories. 
- To ensure compatibility use tagged releases. 
- Main branch can be used for e.g. early testing of new features.
